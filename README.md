This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

## Brief

John Hammond has tasked you with creating an app to help him manage his theme park. He needs to be able to track and manage information about the various dinosaurs in his park and the number of visitors that they will attract.

- A species
- A diet (e.g. carnivore, herbivore or omnivore)

A park must have:

- A name
- A ticket price
- A collection of dinosaurs

A park must be able to:

- Add a dinosaur to its collection of dinosaurs
- Remove a dinosaur from its collection of dinosaurs
- Find the dinosaur that attracts the most visitors
- Find all dinosaurs of a particular species
- Calculate the total number of visitors per day
- Calculate the total number of visitors per year
